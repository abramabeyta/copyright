 <p>I agree with copyright laws and policies because it I don't think it's fair to use someone elses work without giving them credit or paying them. The first example that comees to mind is sampling in music, for decades artists have used other artists' music in their songs , but they ask for permission most of the time. This is where royalty payments and sample clearing comes from.</p>
